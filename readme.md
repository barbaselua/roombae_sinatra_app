# Roombae

*Controlling a Roomba vaccuum from a web server!*

## The Team  

Andreea Barbaselu
Elise Poplawski  
Karlie Romas
Toby Ladislas

## The Hardware

iRobot Roomba Discovery 400  
Raspberry Pi 3  
Transistors and breadboards and wires, oh my!  

## The Software  

Ruby  
Sinatra  
Raspbian  
SSH  
HTML/CSS  

## How we did it  

Through four days of spikes and much trial and error, our team was able to talk to the Roomba with Ruby commands. We then set up a web server on the Raspberry Pi, accessible through our local network.  Through this server is a webpage with a virtual remote control that commands the Roomba.

We wired the Roomba's remote to the Raspberry Pi, and attached the whole assembly atop the Roomba, so we can make it go anywhere this local network reaches!
